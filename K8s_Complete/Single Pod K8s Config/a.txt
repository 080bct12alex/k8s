###
COMMANDS: (order matter)
kubectl apply -f deployment-node-mongo-app.yml
minikube service service-node-mongo-app-single-pod

Monitor the status of  deployments, pods, and services.
     kubectl get all
     minikube dashboard

###
limitation:
here can come a issue if we use 2 pod/replica in deployment yml
Even containers  keep in single pod, k8s try to use any of the replicas mention in  deployment yml  that can cause loss of data if any replicas deleted abd also cause in consistency
