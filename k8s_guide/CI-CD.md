**CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes on AWS**

---

- automate infrastructure provisioning and application deployments. 

- Terraform will provision and manage  infrastructure, including  Kubernetes cluster (Amazon EKS) on AWS.

- Ansible will manage the configuration of the Kubernetes cluster, Set up Prometheus to monitor  Kubernetes cluster and use Grafana to visualize the metrics and deploy applications to Kubernetes.
(using Ansible or Helm to deploy applications to the Kubernetes cluster).

- GitHub Actions will automate the process from source code changes to deployment, triggering Terraform to provision the infrastructure and Ansible to set up Prometheus and Grafana ,deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster.

   - NOTE: can use  Terraform Cloud which automates the entire Terraform workflow


---
# What others can we do 
**Kubernetes Cluster Management**

- Explore other Kubernetes environments:

    - Set up manual production-like environment with tools like kubeadm (manual setup), kops (for AWS), or kind (Kubernetes in Docker) to simulate a multi-node cluster.
